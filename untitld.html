<p style="color:white;font-family:serif;text-align:justify;"> XHTML is an acronym for extensible Hyper Text Markup Language.
<br><br>
The "x" came from XML or extensibie Mark-up Language. Though different from HTML, XHTML also uses the filename extension html.
<br><br>
The content of the actual coding might change because of XHTML conventions but it still holds the same filename extension. </p>
<br><br> 
<h2> Difference of HTML and XHTML </h2>
<p style="color:white;font-family:serif;text-align:justify;"> XHTML is stricter and cleaner version of HTML Aimed to replace HTML
<br>
All new Web browsers support XHTMI, because there came to a point that a huge amount of web pages have been written in the wrong syntax Since web browsers still force to interpret HTML the way they could, sometimes the wrong syntax could still display a logically correct output </p> <br>
<ul style="color:white;font-family:serif;font-size:15px;"> <b> XHTML</b> 
<li> Proper Nesting <br>
Proper nesting of elements has been exemplified and XHTMI elements must be properly nested Proper nesting of elements would mean that, for example if you were to make a piece of text appear in boldface and italics using < b>< /b> and < i>< /i> respectively You would need to close last the first tag you opened</li> <br>
<li> Proper Tag Closing <br>
Recall the container tags Container tags have start and end tags. and end tags are defined by a slash End tags are used to basically close the tag XHTMI requires proper closing of tags 
</li> <br>
<li> Elements in Lowercase Characters <br>
HTML elements MUST be written in lowercase characters 
</li> <br>
<li> One Root Element <br>  All XHTML elements MUST be nested within one root element which is html/html> Therefore, the basic structure for the whole document is
< html>
< head>
< title-One Root< /title>
< /head> 
</li> <br>
<li> Attributes in Lowercase Characters <br>
All XHTML elements MUST be written in lowercase characters same as with the attributes.
</li> <br>
<li> Quoted Values <br>
Values of attributes are described as "usually" enclosed in single and double quotes XHTML requires values to be quoted nevertheless. </li>
