<h1 style="text-align:center;color:white;"> TABLES </h1>

<ul style="color:white;">
<li> Tables also allow you to divide your page into section where you can place headers, footers and navigation links. Almost all websites are laid out using tables. </li>
<li> A table is made up of rows and columns. You can place different elements in each cell like text or image. </li>
<li> A table by default has no borders, so you need to have a value of <b> at least 1 </b> for the border attribute. </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:white;"> CREATING A TABLE </h2>
<ol style="color:white;size:15px;"> 
<li> Tables arrange and organize content into columns and rows. They can be made via the container < table>< /table> tags </li>
<li> Each row within the table is defined by the container tags < tr>< /tr>. Each cell or data within a row is defined by the < td>< /td>. container tags> </li>
<li> Remember that the cells < td>< /td> are placed inside rows < tr>< /tr> and rows are placed inside < table>< /table>. </li>
</ol>
